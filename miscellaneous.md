## ETH Ambassador
##### Official campus tour guide for school classes, visiting groups and public tours.
This very nice student job allowed me to present my passion for the technical sciences and my interest in the history and the structure of ETH Zurich to a broader public. I especially enjoyed tours with high school classes where I promoted the studies at ETH.

## Catering & Hotel temporary jobs
##### World class hotels and private events.
Besides paying a small amount, working in this industry has given me various insights to the industry of hotels itself as well as into various private special events with world famous people I am unfortunately not allowed to tell:)

I worked for instance in the Dolder Hotel of Zurich as well as in Davos during the World Economic Forum.

## Swiss Military Service
##### Soldier of mechanized infantry at [Pz Bat 29] (http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/verbaende/pzbr11/mittel/pzgrenbat29.html)

A very inspiring, demanding but always enjoyable time with many physical and mental border experiences and big impressions. The military system in Switzerland requires 3 weeks of rehearsal for 7 years after going through 5 months of basic training. Here a list of reasons why it is quite enjoyable after all:

* Deep insights in the structure of swiss society by experiencing a group of very diverse people such as street and railroad construction workers, engineering students, farmers, medical students and many more, working together under many different physical and psychological conditions and situations.
* Exercises in beautiful places around entire Switzerland:)
* Trained on tactical communication systems and using IR and nightvision goggles
* Experience in military tactics - some very useful insights in today's belligerent times.
* [Irrelevant but fun: Flew a helicopter and shot a bazooka:)]

Overall, I believe that Swiss military service, given its absolute neutrality, is a very valuable experience for each one and an important service for society. More to that in my [thoughts](/thoughts).
