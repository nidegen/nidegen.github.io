I picked up my engineering background during my [studies at ETH Zurich including an exchange to University of Toronto](../academic/).

Besides my studies I have always loved being involved and taking responsibilities in [volunteering activities](../volunteering/). I have also gained some [related working experience](../miscellaneous/) along the way.

During a long and a short internship I also had first [professional](../professional/) experience.
