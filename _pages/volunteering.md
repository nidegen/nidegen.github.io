## Scout leader
##### Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach (local YMCA scouting organisation)
During my (14 year long) 'career' as scout leader, I was responsible for several events ranging from family days to camping trips up to one week.
I am especially proud how with a group of voluntary, but highly motivated youngsters, we managed to set up very well organised events.
It is during this very diverse occupation that I  forcould apply more of my creativity than at any other job, such as for making up adventures for the kids at the events and camps as well as designing flyers, posters and magazines for the organisation.

[Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach](http://www.cevihe.ch) is the local section of the Swiss scouting organisation Cevi, a Swiss scouting organisation affiliated with YMCA. Run by young people between 15 and 25, it offers saturday-afternoon events for kids in the nature.
It is a valuable experience for kids as well as for the young leaders, where they learn practical skills, from firemaking, hiking, cooking and camp-building to universal social skills like responsibility, building team morale and mutual trust.
