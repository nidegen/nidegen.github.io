## Z端hlke Engineering
##### Product Engineering - 6 Month Internship

During my indiustrial internship at Z端hlke engineering I was given a  deeply inspiring insight in product developememnt, interdisciplinary collaboration and industrial production. I had the opportunty to work on various projects:
  * Optimisation of automated serial production lines.
  * Prototype design and assembly line desig.
  * Medical certification tests.
  * Programming of calibration setups.
  * CAD product design.
  * Market analysis for medical prostethic machining.
  * Innovation workshops: Brainstorming session for generating innovation.

Most memorably remains the impressively innovative and productive combination of highly skilled and experienced specialists from many technical fields, providing an outstandingly environment for product development.
[Z端hlke Engineering](http://www.zuehlke.ch) is a mid size product development and engineering company and one of the leaders of this field in Switzerland.

## Software experience
Some software and languages I have mastered:

* **MATLAB**, the indispensable tool for engineers. From signal processing to Simulink models and a lot of plotting: many lecture exercises, the simulations for my semester project and measurement processing at Z端hkle based on it.
* **C++14**. Entire master thesis and a couple of lectures covering it. Accustomed to Google code style guideline and **unit tests** with gtest, used a Eigen package and openCV.
* For an introduction into **Convolutional Neural Networks** I got my hands dirty with **Python**.
* This websites relies on *Jekyll*, *Markdown* and some *Liquid* and of course I needed some basic stuff like *CSS* and *HTML*.
* Grew up with **Windows**, using **OSX** now but a big fan of Linux. Generally, UNIX systems are awesome I think. And open source of course.
