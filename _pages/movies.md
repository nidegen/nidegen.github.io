## War Movies
### WW2

[A Bridge Too Far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_(film)
Communication problems, wrong intelligence and crossed plans do not happen in swiss army training. Impressive to see the same happening to the British XXX Corps and the American First Allied Airborne Army.

[The Fighting Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fighting_Lady)
Original documentary with live battlefield footage. Geht unter die Haut. Free access on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5JbXRDOP60).
