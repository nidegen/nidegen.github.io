### Local Map Optimization for Visual Inertial Mapping
##### Master Thesis
A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual data. To do so in a large environment, a large global map has to be constructed.
Also for other reasons, but mainly when updating the global map with new data, the visual map needs a readjustment optimising the 3D structure to the measurements.
To limit time and computational size, I implemented and analysed a local optimisation method as an alternative to a global optimisation.

The thesis was written at the [Autonomous System Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch) of Prof. Roland Siegwart. The research was maintained in collaboration with [Google Project Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/).

### Kalman-Filter Enhanced Iterative Learning Control
##### Semester Thesis
Making use of a repeated control task, the information of the experienced error can be used to improve the controller performance dramatically.
My semester thesis consisted of finding a mathematical formulation that allows a comparison of two approaches and an analysis of the differences.

As part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the [Dynamic System Lab](http://schoellig.name) of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Institute for Aerospace Studies.

### Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves
##### Bachelor Thesis

Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emitting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto these particles.

As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.

The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's [Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group](http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/) at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller
