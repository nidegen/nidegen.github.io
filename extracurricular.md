### Scout leader
##### Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach (local YMCA scouting organisation)
During my 'career' as scout leader, I organised several events ranging from family days to camping trips up to one week.
I am especially proud how with a group of voluntary, but highly motivated youngsters, we managed to set up very well organised events.
It is during this very diverse occupation that I could apply more of my creativity than at any other job, such as for making up adventures for the kids at the events and camps as well as designing flyers, posters and magazines for the organisation.

[Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach](http://www.cevihe.ch) is the local section of the Swiss scouting organisation Cevi, a Swiss scouting organisation affiliated with YMCA. Run by young people between 15 and 25, it offers saturday-afternoon events for kids in the nature.
It is a valuable experience for kids as well as for the young leaders, where they learn practical skills, from firemaking, hiking, cooking and camp-building to universal social skills like responsibility, building team morale and mutual trust.

## Misc
### Software experience
Some software and languages I got in touch with:

* MATLAB, the indispensable tool for engineers. From signal processing to Simulink models and a lot of plotting: many lecture exercises, the simulations for my semester project and measurement processing at ZÃ¼hkle based on it.
* C++14. Entire master thesis and a couple of lectures covering it. Accustomed to Google code style guideline and gtest, used a Eigen package and openCV.

### ETH Ambassador
##### Official campus tour guide for school classes, visiting groups and public tours.
This very nice student job allowed me to present my passion for the technical sciences and my interest in the history and the structure of ETH Zurich to a broader public. I especially enjoyed tours with high school classes where I promoted the studies at ETH.

### Swiss Military Service
##### Soldier of mechanized infantry at [Pz Bat 29] (http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/verbaende/pzbr11/mittel/pzgrenbat29.html)

A very inspiring, demanding but always enjoyable time with many physical and mental border experiences and big impressions. The military system in Switzerland requires 3 weeks of rehearsal for 7 years after going through 5 months of basic training. Here a list of reasons why it is quite enjoyable after all:

* Deep insights in the structure of swiss society by experiencing a group of very diverse people such as street and railroad construction workers, engineering students, farmers, medical students and many more, working together under many different physical and psychological conditions and situations.
* Exercises in beautiful places around entire Switzerland:)
* Trained on tactical communication systems and using IR and nightvision goggles
* Experience in military tactics - some very useful insights in today's belligerent times.
* [Irrelevant but fun: Flew a helicopter and shot a bazooka:)]

Overall, I believe that Swiss military service, given its absolute neutrality, is a very valuable experience for each one and an important service for society. More to that in my [thoughts](/thoughts).
