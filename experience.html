      <h3>Local Map Optimization for Visual Inertial Mapping</h3>
      <h5>Master Thesis</h5>
      <p>A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual data. To do so in a large environemnt, a large global map has to be constructed. Also for other reasons, but mainly when updating the global map with new data, the visual map needs a readjustment optimising the 3D structure to the measurements. To limit time and computational size, I implemented and analysed a local optimisation method as an alternative to a global optimisation.</p>

      <p>The thesis was written at the <a href="http://www.asl.ethz.ch"> Autonomous System Lab</a> of Prof. Roland Siegwart. The research was maintained in collaboration with <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/"> Google Project Tango</a>. </p>

      <h3>Kalman-Filter Enhanced Iterative Learning Control</h3>
      <h5>Semester Thesis</h5>
      <p>Making use of a repeated control task, the information of the experienced error can be used to improve the controller performance dramatically. My semester thesis consisted of finding a mathematical formulation that allows a comparison of two approaches and an analysis of the differences.</p>

      <p>As part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the <a href="http://schoellig.name"> Dynamic System Lab</a> of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Insitute for Aerospace Studies.</p>

      <h3>Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves</h3>
      <h5>Bachelor Thesis</h5>
      <p>Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emmiting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto
        these particles.</p>
      <p>As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.</p>
      <p>The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's <a href="http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/"> Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group</a> at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller</p>

    <h3>Scout leader</h3>
<h5>Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach (local YMCA scouting organisation)</h5>
<p>During my 'career' as scout leader, I organised several events ranging from family days to camping trips upd to one week. I am especially proud how with a group of voluntary, but highly motivated youngsters, we managed to set up very well organised events. It is during this very diverse occupation that I could apply more of my creativity than at any other job, such as for making up adventures for the kids at the events and camps as well as designing flyers, posters and magazines for the organisation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cevihe.ch">Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach</a> is the local section of the Swiss scouting organisation Cevi, a Swiss scouting organisation affiliated with YMCA. Run by young people between 15 and 25, it offers saturday-afternoon events for
  kids in the nature. It is a valuable expeerience for kids as well as for the young leaders, where they learn practical skills, from firemaking, hiking, cooking and camp-building to universal social skills like resonsibility, buidling team morale and
  mutual trust.</p>

      <h3>Software experience</h3>
      <p>Some software and languages I got in touch with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MATLAB, the indispensable tool for engineers. From signal processing to Simulink models and a lot of plotting: many lecture exercises, the simulations for my semester project and measurment processing at Zühkle based on it.</li>
        <li>C++14. Entire master thesis and a couple of lectures covering it. Accustomed to Goolge code style guideline and gtest, used a Eigen package and openCV.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ETH Ambassador</h3>
      <h5>Oficial campus tour guide for school classes, visiting groups and public tours.</h5>
      <p>This very nice student job allowed me to present my passion for the techical sciences and my interest in the history and the structure of ETH Zurich to a broader public. I especially enjoyed tours with hogh school classes where I promoted the studies at ETH. </p>

      <h3>Swiss Military Service</h3>
      <h5>Soldier of mechanized infantry at <a href="http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/verbaende/pzbr11/mittel/pzgrenbat29.html">Pz Bat 29</a></h5>
      <p>A very inspiring, demanding but always enjoyable time with many physical and mental border experiences and big impressions. The military system in Switzerland requires 3 weeks of rehearsal for 7 years after going through 5 months of basic training. Here a list of reasons why it is quite enjoyable after all:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep insights in the structure of swiss society by experiencing a group of very diverse people such as street and railroad construction workers, engineering students, farmers, medical students and many more, working together under many different physical and psychological conditions and situations.</li>
        <li>Exercises in beautiful places around entire Switzerland.</li>
        <li>Trained on tactical communication systems and using IR and nightvision goggles</li>
        <li> From riding tanks, flying helicopters and training on hand grenades, grenade launcher, SIG 550, M249, Panzerfaust 3, a lot was in the program:)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, I believe that Swiss military service, given its absolute neutrality, is a very valuable experience for each one and an important service for society. More to that in my <a href="./thoughts.html">thoughts</a>.</p>
