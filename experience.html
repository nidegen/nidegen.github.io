      <h3>Local Map Optimization for Visual Inertial Mapping</h3>
      <h5>Master Thesis</h5>
      <p>A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual data. To do so in a large environemnt, a large global map has to be constructed. Also for other reasons, but mainly when updating the global map with new data, the visual map needs a readjustment optimising the 3D structure to the measurements. To limit time and computational size, I implemented and analysed a local optimisation method as an alternative to a global optimisation.</p>

      <p>The thesis was written at the <a href="http://www.asl.ethz.ch"> Autonomous System Lab</a> of Prof. Roland Siegwart. The research was maintained in collaboration with <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/"> Google Project Tango</a>. </p>

      <h3>Kalman-Filter Enhanced Iterative Learning Control</h3>
      <h5>Semester Thesis</h5>
      <p>Making use of a repeated control task, the information of the experienced error can be used to improve the controller performance dramatically. My semester thesis consisted of finding a mathematical formulation that allows a comparison of two approaches and an analysis of the differences.</p>

      <p>As part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the <a href="http://schoellig.name"> Dynamic System Lab</a> of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Insitute for Aerospace Studies.</p>

      <h3>Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves</h3>
      <h5>Bachelor Thesis</h5>
      <p>Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emmiting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto
        these particles.</p>
      <p>As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.</p>
      <p>The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's <a href="http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/"> Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group</a> at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller</p>

    <h3>Scout leader</h3>
<h5>Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach (local YMCA scouting organisation)</h5>
<p>During my 'career' as scout leader, I organised several events ranging from family days to camping trips upd to one week. I am especially proud how with a group of voluntary, but highly motivated youngsters, we managed to set up very well organised events. It is during this very diverse occupation that I could apply more of my creativity than at any other job, such as for making up adventures for the kids at the events and camps as well as designing flyers, posters and magazines for the organisation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cevihe.ch">Cevi Herrliberg Erlenbach</a> is the local section of the Swiss scouting organisation Cevi, a Swiss scouting organisation affiliated with YMCA. Run by young people between 15 and 25, it offers saturday-afternoon events for
  kids in the nature. It is a valuable expeerience for kids as well as for the young leaders, where they learn practical skills, from firemaking, hiking, cooking and camp-building to universal social skills like resonsibility, buidling team morale and
  mutual trust.</p>
