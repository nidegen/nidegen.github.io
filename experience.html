        <h3>Optimization Windows for Multiagent Visual Inertial Mapping</h3>
        <h5>Master Thesis</h5>
        <p>A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual-inertial data.</p>

        <p>Part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the <a href="http://schoellig.name"> Dynamic System Lab</a> of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Insitute for Aerospace Studies.</p><p>-</p>

        <h3>Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves</h3>
        <h5>Bachelor Thesis</h5>
        <p>Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emmiting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto these particles.</p>
        <p>As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.</p>
        <p>The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's <a href="http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/"> Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group</a> at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller</p>
        <p>Publication: <a href=http://www.jnanobiotechnology.com/content/11/1/21/>Article in Journal of Nanobiotechnology 2013, 11:21</a></p><p>-</p>


        <h3>Mechanical, Control and Robotics Engineering</h3>
