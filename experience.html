      <h3>Optimization Windows for Multiagent Visual Inertial Mapping</h3>
      <h5>Master Thesis</h5>
      <p>A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual-inertial data.</p>

      <p>Part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the <a href="http://schoellig.name"> Dynamic System Lab</a> of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Insitute for Aerospace Studies.</p>

      <h3>Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves</h3>
      <h5>Bachelor Thesis</h5>
      <p>Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emmiting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto
        these particles.</p>
      <p>As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.</p>
      <p>The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's <a href="http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/"> Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group</a> at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller</p>

      <h3>Software experience</h3>
      <p>Some software and languages I got in touch with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MATLAB, the unavoidable tool for engineers. From signal processing to Simulink models and a lot of plotting: many lecture exercises and some simulations for my semester project.</li>
        <li>C++14. Entire master thesis and a couple of lectures covering it. Accustomed to Goolge code style guideline and gtest, used a Eigen package and openCV.</li>
