### Local Map Optimization for Visual Inertial Mapping
##### Master Thesis
A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual data. To do so in a large environment, a large global map has to be constructed.
Also for other reasons, but mainly when updating the global map with new data, the visual map needs a readjustment optimising the 3D structure to the measurements.
To limit time and computational size, I implemented and analysed a local optimisation method as an alternative to a global optimisation.

The thesis was written at the [Autonomous System Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch) of Prof. Roland Siegwart. The research was maintained in collaboration with [Google Project Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/).

### Kalman-Filter Enhanced Iterative Learning Control
##### Semester Thesis
Making use of a repeated control task, the information of the experienced error can be used to improve the controller performance dramatically.
My semester thesis consisted of finding a mathematical formulation that allows a comparison of two approaches and an analysis of the differences.

As part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the [Dynamic System Lab](http://schoellig.name) of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Institute for Aerospace Studies.

### Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves
##### Bachelor Thesis

Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emitting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto these particles.

As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.

The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's [Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group](http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/) at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller

### Zühlke Engineering
##### Product Engineering - 6 Month Internship

During my indiustrial internship at Zühlke engineering I was given a  deeply inspiring insight in product developememnt, interdisciplinary collaboration and industrial production. I had the opportunty to work on various projects:
  * Optimisation of automated serial production lines.
  * Prototype design and assembly line desig.
  * Medical certification tests.
  * Programming of calibration setups.
  * CAD product design.
  * Market analysis for medical prostethic machining.
  * Innovation workshops: Brainstorming session for generating innovation.

Most memorably remains the impressively innovative and productive combination of highly skilled and experienced specialists from many technical fields, providing an outstandingly environment for product development.
[Zühlke Engineering](http://www.zuehlke.ch) is a mid size product development and engineering company and one of the leaders of this field in Switzerland.
