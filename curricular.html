  <h3>Local Map Optimization for Visual Inertial Mapping</h3>
  <h5>Master Thesis</h5>
  <p>A long term goal for autonomous robot research is to develop an accurate localisation technique based on visual data. To do so in a large environemnt, a large global map has to be constructed. Also for other reasons, but mainly when updating the global map with new data, the visual map needs a readjustment optimising the 3D structure to the measurements. To limit time and computational size, I implemented and analysed a local optimisation method as an alternative to a global optimisation.</p>

  <p>The thesis was written at the <a href="http://www.asl.ethz.ch"> Autonomous System Lab</a> of Prof. Roland Siegwart. The research was maintained in collaboration with <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/"> Google Project Tango</a>. </p>

  <h3>Kalman-Filter Enhanced Iterative Learning Control</h3>
  <h5>Semester Thesis</h5>
  <p>Making use of a repeated control task, the information of the experienced error can be used to improve the controller performance dramatically. My semester thesis consisted of finding a mathematical formulation that allows a comparison of two approaches and an analysis of the differences.</p>

  <p>As part of my master degree at ETH Zürich, I wrote my semester thesis during an exchange semester at the <a href="http://schoellig.name"> Dynamic System Lab</a> of Prof. Angela Schoellig in University of Toronto's Insitute for Aerospace Studies.</p>

  <h3>Setup for Schlieren Visualization of Ultrasound waves</h3>
  <h5>Bachelor Thesis</h5>
  <p>Acoustic manipulations is a research field that tries to apply a force to particles suspended in a water chamber by emmiting acoustic waves, presumably ultrasound, and thus creating standing waves with pressure gradients that result in forces onto
    these particles.</p>
    <p>As a bachelor thesis, I developed an optical setup that made use of the Schlieren visualization technique to visualise the standing ultrasonic waves that were produced inside of a water filled 20x20x2mm transparent plastic box with piezo actuators.</p>
    <p>The Research was performed in Prof. Jürg Dual's <a href="http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/e/exp-dyn/"> Mechanics and Experimental Dynamics Group</a> at the Institute for Mechanical Systems of ETH Zürich, supervised by Dr. Dirk Möller</p>

      <h3>Zühlke Engineering</h3>
      <h5>Product Engineering - 6 Month Internship</h5>

      <p>During my indiustrial internship at Zühlke engineering I was given a  deeply inspiring insight in product developememnt, interdisciplinary collaboration and industrial production. I had the opportunty to work on various projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimisation of automated serial production lines.</li>
        <li>Prototype design and assembly line desig.</li>
        <li>Medical certification tests.</li>
        <li>Programming of calibration setups.</li>
        <li>CAD product design.</li>
        <li>Market analysis for medical prostethic machining.</li>
        <li>Innovation workshops: Brainstorming session for generating innovation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most memorably remains the impressively innovative and productive combination of highly skilled and experienced specialists from many technical fields, providing an outstandingly environment for product developement.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.zuehlke.ch"> Zühlke Engineering</a> is a mid size product development and engineering company and one of the leaders of this field in Switzerland.</p>
